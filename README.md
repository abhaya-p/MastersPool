# MastersPool
Using a golf API to create a tableau public application for a pool. I leverage the API data to run hourly, updating the scores for the "live leaderboard".  I join the players names to picks that were submitted by each participant. 
Each participant submitted picks via EXCEL and they were unionized to create a large data set - this was then joined to the api data in Tableau Public.
